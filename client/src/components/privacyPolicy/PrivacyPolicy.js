Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.</p>

                        <p>Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Policy will change too. You should check our website frequently to see recent changes.
